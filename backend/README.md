# FinSmart API — Backend

A clean, no-nonsense REST API that powers the FinSmart personal finance dashboard. It handles user authentication, transaction tracking, and budget management — all backed by MongoDB and Express.js.

## What This Does

At its core, this backend gives the frontend everything it needs to run a personal finance app:

- **Sign up, log in, log out** — JWT tokens delivered via HTTP-only cookies. No localStorage token nonsense.
- **Track transactions** — Record income and expenses with categories, dates, and descriptions. Filter them by year, month, category, type, or free-text search.
- **Set budgets** — Define monthly spending limits overall and per category. Get a summary that compares what you planned to spend against what you actually spent.
- **Dynamic filter dropdowns** — The API surfaces which years, months, categories, and types actually exist in your data so the frontend doesn't show empty options.
- **AI financial chat** — Ask questions about your finances in natural language. A Gemini-powered assistant analyzes your transaction history, budgets, and spending trends to give contextual, personalized financial advice. Sessions are persisted so you can pick up conversations where you left off.

## How It's Built

| Layer | What's Used |
|-------|-------------|
| Runtime | Node.js (ES modules) |
| Framework | Express 5 |
| Database | MongoDB via Mongoose 9 |
| Auth | JWT in HTTP-only cookies |
| Validation | Joi schemas |
| Password Hashing | bcryptjs |
| AI | Google Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| Logging | Morgan (dev mode) |

### Architecture

FinSmart backend follows a lightweight, decoupled layered pattern separating Routes, Controllers, Services, and Models for maximal readability. Controllers handle request logic and business flow, while dedicated Services map complex queries and interface with MongoDB.

---

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized cleanly to separate concerns:

- `src/controllers/` - Logic for processing requests
- `src/models/` - Database schemas
- `src/routes/` - API endpoint definitions
- `src/middlewares/` - Authentication and validation logic
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions

---

## Getting It Running

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- **MongoDB** — either a local instance or MongoDB Atlas
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file with these values:
# PORT=8000
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
# JWT_SECRET=something-long-and-random
# JWT_EXPIRY=7d
# NODE_ENV=development
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your-google-gemini-api-key
# CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Start the dev server (auto-restarts on file changes)
npm run dev
```

Server will be up at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

Base URL: `http://localhost:8000/api`

### Users

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| POST | `/users/register` | Create a new account | No |
| POST | `/users/login` | Log in | No |
| POST | `/users/logout` | Log out (clears cookie) | Yes |
| GET | `/users/me` | Get your profile | Yes |
| PUT | `/users/change-password` | Update password | Yes |

### Transactions

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| GET | `/transactions/filters` | Get available filter options (years, months, categories, types) | Yes |
| GET | `/transactions` | List transactions (paginated, filterable) | Yes |
| GET | `/transactions/:id` | Get a single transaction | Yes |
| POST | `/transactions` | Add a transaction | Yes |
| PUT | `/transactions/:id` | Update a transaction | Yes |
| DELETE | `/transactions/:id` | Delete a transaction | Yes |

**Query parameters for listing transactions:**
- `page` — page number (default: 1)
- `limit` — items per page (default: 20)
- `year` — filter by year
- `month` — filter by month (1-12)
- `category` — filter by category
- `type` — filter by "Income" or "Expense"
- `search` — free-text search across description, category, and type

### Budgets

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| POST | `/budgets` | Set or update a budget (upsert) | Yes |
| GET | `/budgets` | Get budget for a specific month/year | Yes |
| GET | `/budgets/summary` | Get full budget summary with actual spending | Yes |

**Query parameters for budget endpoints:**
- `year` — defaults to current year
- `month` — defaults to current month (1-12)

The `/summary` endpoint is the interesting one — it aggregates your transactions for the month and tells you total income, total expenses, net savings, and how each category's spending compares to your set limit.

### Chat (AI Financial Assistant)

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| POST | `/chat/message` | Send a message and get an AI response (creates or continues a session) | Yes |
| GET | `/chat/sessions` | List all chat sessions for the user | Yes |
| GET | `/chat/sessions/:id` | Get a specific chat session with full message history | Yes |
| DELETE | `/chat/sessions/:id` | Delete a chat session | Yes |

**Request body for `/chat/message`:**
```json
{
  "message": "What are my biggest expense categories this month?",
  "sessionId": "optional-existing-session-id"
}
```

If `sessionId` is provided, the AI continues the conversation with full context. If omitted, a new session is created. The first message in a session triggers a snapshot of your financial data (last 12 months of transactions, budgets, spending trends) which is sent to Gemini as context.

**Response from `/chat/message`:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "...",
  "title": "Expense breakdown",
  "updatedAt": "...",
  "reply": "Your top expense this month was..."
}
```

Chat titles are auto-generated from the first message using pattern matching (e.g., "show me my expenses" → "Expenses", "how much did I spend on food" → "Spend on food").

### Health Check

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/` | Returns "Server is running" |

## Authentication

Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies — the frontend doesn't need to manually attach them to requests. Here's the flow:

1. **Register or login** → server sets a `token` cookie with a JWT.
2. **Protected routes** → the `verifyJWT` middleware reads the token from the cookie (or `Authorization: Bearer` header as a fallback), decodes it, and attaches the user to `req.user`.
3. **Logout** → server clears the cookie.

The JWT contains the user's `_id` and `email`. Token expiry is controlled by `JWT_EXPIRY` in the `.env` file.

**Cookie configuration:**
- `httpOnly: true` — inaccessible to client-side JavaScript.
- `secure: true` in production, `false` in development — requires HTTPS in production.
- `sameSite: "none"` in production, `"lax"` in development — paired with CORS `credentials: true` for same-origin frontend communication.

### Example: Login

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}' \
  -c cookies.txt
```

The `-c cookies.txt` flag saves the cookie for subsequent requests.

## Data Models

### User

```js
{
  name: String,          // required
  email: String,         // required, unique, lowercase, indexed
  password: String,      // required, hashed before save
  createdAt: Date,       // auto
  updatedAt: Date        // auto
}
```

### Transaction

```js
{
  userId: ObjectId,      // ref: User, required, indexed
  amount: Number,        // required
  type: String,          // "Income" | "Expense", required, indexed
  category: String,      // required, indexed
  date: Date,            // required, indexed, defaults to now
  desc: String,          // optional description
  createdAt: Date,       // auto
  updatedAt: Date        // auto
}
```

Compound indexes on `(userId, date)`, `(userId, category)`, and `(userId, type)` keep common queries fast.

### Budget

```js
{
  userId: ObjectId,      // ref: User, required
  year: Number,          // required
  month: Number,         // required (1-12)
  monthlyBudget: Number, // required, default: 0
  savingsTarget: Number, // default: 0
  categoryLimits: [{     // per-category spending caps
    category: String,
    limit: Number
  }],
  createdAt: Date,       // auto
  updatedAt: Date        // auto
}
```

A unique compound index on `(userId, year, month)` ensures one budget per user per month. Setting a budget for the same month again updates it in place.

### ChatSession

```js
{
  userId: ObjectId,      // ref: User, required, indexed
  title: String,         // auto-generated from first message, default: "New Chat"
  messages: [{           // conversation history
    role: String,        // "user" or "model", required
    content: String,     // required
    createdAt: Date,     // auto
    updatedAt: Date      // auto
  }],
  contextSnapshot: Mixed,// financial data snapshot at session creation (null until first message)
  createdAt: Date,       // auto
  updatedAt: Date        // auto
}
```

A compound index on `(userId, updatedAt)` enables efficient listing of sessions by recency. The `contextSnapshot` field stores a JSON snapshot of the user's financial data (last 12 months of transactions, budgets, spending trends) captured when the first message is sent — this is what the AI uses to give contextual answers.

---

## Validation & Error Handling

Every incoming request body is validated against a Joi schema before it reaches the controller. If validation fails, you get a 400 with a clear message about what went wrong.

Errors flow through a global error handler that:

- In **development**: returns the full error object and stack trace.
- In **production**: returns only a clean message — no internals leaked.

Unknown route paths get caught by a 404 handler at the bottom of the middleware stack.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PORT` | No | Port to listen on. Defaults to `8000`. |
| `MONGODB_URI` | **Yes** | MongoDB connection string (without database name — the app appends `/finsmart`). |
| `JWT_SECRET` | **Yes** | Secret key for signing JWTs. Make it long and random. |
| `JWT_EXPIRY` | No | Token expiry duration. Defaults to `7d`. |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | `development` or `production`. Controls error verbosity and cookie `secure` flag. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | **Yes** | Google Gemini API key for the AI chat feature. Get it from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). |
| `CLIENT_URL` | No | Frontend origin for CORS configuration. Defaults to `http://localhost:5173`. |

## Design Decisions Worth Noting

**Cookie-based auth over localStorage** — HTTP-only cookies are immune to XSS token theft. The tradeoff is CSRF, but since this is paired with a same-origin frontend (via CORS `credentials: true` and `sameSite: "lax"` in dev / `"none"` + `secure: true` in production), the risk is mitigated.

**Services and repositories** — Not every controller needs them. Simple CRUD (like user profile) lives directly in the controller. But transaction filtering uses a `buildTransactionMatch()` service to construct query filters, and a repository to run `$facet` aggregations for dynamic dropdowns. This keeps the controller readable.

**AI financial assistant** — The chat feature uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash. On the first message of a session, the system aggregates the user's last 12 months of financial data (transactions, budgets, spending trends, top categories) into a `contextSnapshot` that's attached to the session. This snapshot is sent to Gemini as part of the system prompt, so the AI answers based on *actual* financial data, not generic advice. Conversation history is preserved across messages within a session. Session titles are auto-generated from the first message using pure JS pattern matching — no extra API call needed.

**Upsert for budgets** — Instead of separate "create" and "update" endpoints, `setBudget` uses `findOneAndUpdate` with `upsert: true`. One endpoint, one less thing to think about.

**Dynamic filters** — The `/transactions/filters` endpoint doesn't return hardcoded options. It runs an aggregation on your actual data, so if you only have transactions from 2025 and 2026, the dropdown only shows those years. No stale options.

**Indexed queries** — Compound indexes on the most common query patterns (`userId + date`, `userId + category`, `userId + type`) keep the API responsive even as transaction counts grow.
